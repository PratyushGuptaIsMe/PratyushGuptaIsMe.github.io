            <p>I made this website because I wanted a place to share my projects. It is not here to show off who I am or to act like a profile page. It is here to keep the things I make in one place and give them a home on the internet. I like having my work displayed in a simple way. Nothing too complex, just clean and easy to understand.</p>

                <span class="floatright figcaption_span_dummyImg">
                    <img id="imgdummy" alt="dummy img" class="main_image">
                    <figcaption class="figcap">Dummy Image</figcaption>
                </span>
                <script>
                    insertRandomImgToHTMLImgTag("imgdummy");
                </script>

            <p>My name is <span class="boldify">pratyushguptaisme</span>, and I enjoy coding. Coding is one of the things that keeps me interested every day. I like writing programs, making things function, and seeing the results of what I build. There is always something new to learn when I sit down to code. It can be a big project or just a small piece of code, but each one teaches me something. This website is where I can share those projects and let them speak for themselves.</p>

            <p>When I work on code, I feel like I am solving little puzzles. It makes me think, but it also gives me moments of fun. I like the process of testing, fixing errors, and finally getting something to run the way I wanted it to. Sometimes it takes patience, but the outcome is worth it. That is why I continue making new things and adding them to my GitHub. The more I build, the more I understand, and the more I can improve.</p>

            <p>Besides coding, there are small things that make me happy. For example, I love cookies. It is simple, but it is true. Cookies are my favorite snack, and I will always take a cookie any day. Chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, or just about any kind of cookie are good to me. Cookies might not be a project, but they are still something I care about. They bring me joy, just like coding does in its own way.</p>

            <p>Another thing I like is the idea and the meme of Among Us. I don't really play the game, but I enjoy how the whole idea of imposters and crewmates became such a funny part of internet culture. It is one of those memes that just makes me laugh. I like how something so simple turned into a huge shared joke across the internet.</p>
                
                <span class="floatleft figcaption_span_amongusImg">
                    <img id="amongusimg" alt="dummy img" class="main_image">
                    <figcaption class="figcap">Amongus</figcaption>
                </span>
                <script>
                    insertImgToTag("amongusimg", "images/amogus.webp", "300px", "300px");
                </script>

            <p>Life does not have to be complicated for me. I enjoy the basic things. Coding gives me a place to create. Cookies give me a reason to smile. Internet jokes like Among Us give me a reason to laugh. These small things make up a lot of my day-to-day joy. And through all of it, I keep working on projects and learning more along the way.</p>

            <p>If you want to contact me, you can send me an email at <span class="boldify">pratyushngupta@gmail.com</span>. If you want to see more of my work, my GitHub is also under the same name, <span class="boldify">PratyushGuptaIsMe</span>. That is where I keep my projects and code. It is the best place to look if you are curious about what I have been making.</p>

            <p>I made this site to give my projects their own space, not to be a long story about myself. Still, I think it helps to explain a little about who is behind the work. I like coding, I like cookies, and I like memes. That is enough to give a picture of me. The real focus here will always be the projects themselves. Over time, I will add more of them, update what I build, and continue learning. The site will grow as I grow.</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, I am pratyushguptaisme. I write code, I enjoy cookies, and I laugh at memes. This website is where I share the things I make, and I hope anyone who visits finds something interesting here.</p>
